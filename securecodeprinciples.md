For 2025, a Cyber Secure Coder outline typically follows the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and is heavily influenced by industry standards from organizations like the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) and SANS Institute. The curriculum emphasizes moving security from a late-stage add-on to an integrated practice throughout the entire development process. 
Module 1: Introduction to secure coding

•	Software security fundamentals: Understand the core concepts of secure coding, including the difference between functional requirements and security abuse cases.
•	Security by design: Apply a "shift-left" philosophy to integrate security considerations into the design and architecture phases, rather than addressing them at the end.
•	Threat modeling: Learn to proactively identify and analyze potential threats to an application early in the development cycle.
•	The developer's role: Recognize the critical importance of developers in building secure software and how to incorporate security as a primary quality attribute. 
Module 2: Identifying and handling vulnerabilities
•	Understanding common flaws: Learn about the most common and dangerous software errors, often categorized in resources like the OWASP Top 10 and CWE Top 25.
•	Vulnerability intelligence: Learn how to find and use information on known vulnerabilities and exploits to understand potential attack vectors.
•	The human element: Address how vulnerabilities can be introduced through human factors and process shortcomings, not just technical defects. 

Module 3: Secure coding practices
•	Input validation and sanitization: Enforce strict validation of all data from untrusted sources, including user input and data from file streams or databases. Use allow-lists instead of deny-lists.
•	Output encoding: Properly encode all data sent to the client side to prevent injection attacks, ensuring data is displayed as intended and not executed as code.
•	Authentication and session management: Implement secure and centralized authentication and session management controls. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA), secure password hashing, and secure session token handling.
•	Access control: Enforce the principle of least privilege. Implement a site-wide component for authorization and ensure access controls are enforced on the server-side for every request.
•	Secure cryptographic practices: Use approved, well-vetted cryptographic libraries for handling sensitive data. Manage cryptographic keys securely and protect data both in transit and at rest.
•	API security: Implement robust authentication, authorization, and input validation for modern applications relying on APIs, including web services like REST and SOAP. 

Module 4: Implementing common protections
•	Database security: Use strongly typed, parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Connect to databases with the lowest possible level of privilege.
•	Error handling and logging: Implement robust error handling that fails securely without revealing sensitive information. Use logging to support security monitoring and incident response.
•	File management: Secure file uploads by restricting file types and turning off execution privileges in upload directories. Never pass user-supplied data to dynamic file functions.
•	Memory management: Implement safe memory management practices to prevent common buffer overflows and other memory-related exploits.
•	Data protection: Encrypt sensitive data in storage and transit. Do not store sensitive information in logs or comments. 

Module 5: Security testing and maintenance
•	Static analysis (SAST): Use automated tools to scan source code for potential security problems without running the application.
•	Dynamic analysis (DAST): Use automated tools to test a running application by simulating attacks and analyzing its response.
•	Manual security testing: Perform manual code reviews and penetration testing to find vulnerabilities that automated tools might miss.
•	Security maintenance: Establish a process for monitoring and patching deployed applications, ensuring ongoing security and responding to new threats. 

Module 6: Special topics in secure coding
•	Securing AI/ML applications: Address vulnerabilities specific to AI systems, such as prompt injection, model tampering, and data leakage.
•	DevSecOps automation: Integrate security controls into continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to secure cloud-native and DevOps environments.
•	Mobile and IoT security: Learn about secure coding practices and common vulnerabilities specific to mobile devices and the Internet of Things (IoT).
•	Compliance and standards: Incorporate relevant standards and regulations, such as PCI DSS, into secure coding practices.
